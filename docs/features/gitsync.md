*GitSync is another project maintained by Megabyte Labs. It aims to be one-stop boilerplate solution for all the technologies we leverage in our eco-system. GitSync will also be able to patch pre-existing projects by integrating must-have git hooks, auto-fixers, linters, and CI/CD definitions. For now, this page is a placeholder for the details on how Install Doctor integrates GitSync into provisioned devices. While Install Doctor is still in development, be sure to engage with the various channels outlined on the [Community](https://install.doctor/community) page to help Install Doctor become a thriving mission-driven, open-source community.*
