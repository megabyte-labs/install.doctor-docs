This page is a placeholder for a guide about integrating CloudFlare Teams into the Install Doctor stack. By incorporating CloudFlare Teams, Install Doctor managed devices will be able to securely host web applications available over the public internet by protecting all your endpoints with a single sign-on provider of your choice. This is currently a work in progress. If you are interested in helping integrate CloudFlare Teams into the Install Doctor stack then please contact our team by using one of the channels linked to by our [Community](https://install.doctor/community) page.
