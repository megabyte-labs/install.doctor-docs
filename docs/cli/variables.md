This page serves as a place to centralize the location where the "special" variables used to customize the behavior of our scripts. This is important to us so that things like having to set both the `DEBUG` and `DEBUG_MODE` environment variables to turn on debug mode do not happen.

Before integrating scripts that leverage environment variables to modify their side effects, this table should be referred to so as to avoid collisions and maintain a consistent naming format.

## Shell Script Environment Variables

Shell scripts (i.e. Bash in most cases) should use a snake case format. They should also be short, yet descriptive and avoid collisions with variables that might be used by third party scripts.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DISABLE_LINT` | Disables linting (leveraged by the `remark-preset-strict-lint` NPM package) |
| `ESLINT_STAGED_ONLY` | Runs ESLint only on staged git changes. |
| `REMARK_BEHEAD` | Ensures no H1 / # header exists in a markdown file that is processed using the `remark-preset-strict-lint` NPM package configuration (i.e. any single `#` header gets turned into a `##` header) |
| `REMARK_HTML` | Enable this variable to have the resulting markdown file generated by `remark-preset-strict-lint` converted to HTML format |
| `REMARK_MAN` | Enable this variable to have the resulting markdown file generated by the `remark-preset-strict-lint` configuration into a Linux `man` page style document |
| `REMARK_REMOVE` | When working with the `remark-preset-strict-lint` NPM configuration, set this variable to a string that you would like to dictate the string that is searched for while removing sections of a markdown file that are wrapped with a comment using the `<-- ${REMARK_REMOVE}:START` and `${REMARK_REMOVE} -->` value |
| `MERMAID_CHROME_EXE` | When leveraging the `remark-preset-strict-lint` configuration, this variable defines the path to the Chrome executable you would like to use for the Puppeteer instance necessary to render markdown charts with [MermaidJS](https://mermaid.js.org/). Generally, you can set this to `MERMAID_CHROME_EXE="$(which chrome)"` |
