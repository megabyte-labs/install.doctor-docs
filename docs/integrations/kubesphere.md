*This page is a placeholder to outline the KubeSphere integration details. Currently, we plan on integrating KubeSphere to leverage its hybrid multi-cloud functionality. The KubeSphere integration will combine the cost-savings of bare-metal with the reliability of cloud by intelligently load-balancing critical services across multiple clouds. While Install Doctor KubeSphere integration is still in development, be sure to engage with the various channels outlined on the [Community](https://install.doctor/community) page to stay up-to-date on the latest news.*

KubeSphere integration will provide the following:

* Kubernetes hybrid multi-cloud support (e.g. your on-premise cluster seemlessly combined with cloud-hosted cluster)
* Automatic deployment of supported KubeSphere applications
* CloudFlare DNS Load Balancer integration to redirect traffic from bare-metal to the cloud for critical services
* An interesting entry-point for both beginners and advanced users who are interested in learning more about Kubernetes
